## This file is meant to remind you what a chi squared test is and how its used

#### Setting up the data

```{R}
    data <- matrix(c(30, 25, 20, 25), nrow = 2, byrow = FALSE)
    # nrow means that the matrix has 2 rows
    # byrow = TRUE means that the vector is filled in from left to right, then down a row
    # byrow = FALSE means that the vector is filled in top to bottom in the first column, then over one column

    rownames(data) <- c("Male", "Female")
    colnames(data) <- c("Owns dog (Yes)", "Owns dog (No)")

    data
```

#### Doing the chi squared test

```{R}
    chi_sq_test <- chisq.test(data)

    chi_sq_test
```

If the $p-val < 0.05$ we reject $H_0$ and conclude that there is significant evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between the 2 variables

If the $p-val > 0.05$ we fail to reject $H_0$ and conclude that there is no significant evidence to suggest a relationship between the 2 variables

##### This chi squared test is called the chi squared test of independence:

It tests if the 2 variables being compared are independent of each other\
1. If we fail to reject, then the variables are independent of each other\
2. If we reject, then the variables are correlated and one variable can be used for prediction on the other

### Example 1

A survey was conducted to understand the relationship between people's preferred type of pet and their age group.

```{R}
    ex1 <- matrix(c(50, 70, 30, 40, 50, 40, 10, 20, 40), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
    colnames(ex1) <- c("Under 30", "30-50", "Over 50")
    rownames(ex1) <- c("Dogs", "Cats", "Other")
    ex1

    test <- chisq.test(ex1)

    test
```

$$
    \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
$$
