## Contingency Tables

#### Joint, Marginal and Conditional Probabilities

$\pi_{ij} = P(X=i, Y=j)$

ith row, jth column

$\sum \pi_{ij}=1$ (probabilities of all cells sum up to 1)

These $\pi_{ij}'s$ form the joint distribution of X and Y

$\hat{\pi}_{ij} = n_{ij}/n$ where n is the total sample size and $n_{ij}$ is the number of observations in the ith row and jth column

The marginal distributions are the row and column totals of the joint probabilities

For a 2x2 table, $\pi_{1+}=\pi_{11}+\pi_{12}$ and $\pi_{+1}=\pi_{11}+\pi_{21}$

The conditional probabilities come from holding one of the variables constant. $P(X=1 | Y=1)$ or $P(X=1|Y=2)$

### Sensitivity and Specificity

$Sensitivity = P(X=1|Y=1)$

$Specificity = P(X=2|Y=2)$

### Independence

2 categorical variables X and Y that are *both response variables* are said to be independent if $P(X=i, Y=j) = P(X=i)*P(Y=j)$ for all i, j

$\pi_{ij}=\pi_{i+}*\pi_{+j}$
