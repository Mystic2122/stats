### Correlation does not Equal Causation 

Two things can look related, but this can be an illusion created out of randomness.

### Correlation

-   Larger X value resulting in a larger Y value is called positive association

-   Larger X value resulting in a smaller Y value is called negative association

$$
\rho = \frac{E[(X_i-EX)(Y_i-EY)]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}
$$

$\rho$ is the correlation coefficient

In the numerator, $E[(X_i-EX)(Y_i-EY)] = Cov(X,Y)$

By dividing by $\sigma_X \sigma_Y$ we standardize $\rho$ such that $-1 \leq \rho \leq 1$

Correlation says nothing about how one variable effects the other, it just shows that the they tend to vary in the same (positive) or opposite (negative) direction.

Causation on the other hand, shows how a change in one variable creates a change in the other variable.
