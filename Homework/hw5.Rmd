Questions: 2.18, 2.21, 2.22, 2.28

## Question 2.18

Yes, it is valid to apply the chi-squared test of independence here since all counts in each cell are â‰¥ 5 In this table, each factor (A, B, C) represents a separate categorical variable. We can use this table to create 3 separate 2x2 contingency tables. Since the number of men and women who disagree with each statement are implied (100-number who agree), we have all the information we need to cross-classify gender with each of the three statements.

```{r}
contingency.table <- data.frame(Gender = c("Men", "Women"),
                                Agree_A = c(60,70),
                                Disagree_A = c(40,25))
print(contingency.table)
```
